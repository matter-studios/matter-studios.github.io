Definitely in person, and probably over food, also depending on your food preference. Throughout all these conversations, together we’ll figure out what this project really is, what we want to do, what you need to pull it off, what we feel like we can contribute, what the budget is, the timeline, the greatest potential for it, etc. We’ll also find time to talk about art and storytelling and ideas that move us, because this is what we talk about with people we are getting to know.

Make no mistake, we want our work to be huge, but our primary metric is culture. We’re interested in storytelling with impact. And in a world obsessed with quantifiable economic output--probabilities, subscribers, uniques--it’s hard to find a space for art because art is fuzzy, unreliable, subjective. We’re placing our bets on creative personal expression and changing the way art is made, distributed, and consumed.

              Studies have shown that our brain takes three hundredths of a second to decide to trust someone.

Some people default to trust until a person gives you a reason not to, other people are more in the guilty-until-proven-trustworthy camp. No matter where you with Matter w/r/t the trust question, know that we’re a transparent company (but actually), we want to help incredible storytellers thrive, and we care deeply about our work.

Because, think about it. Stories with raw, provocative feeling; from individual, electric voices; filled with fearless thinking and deep reporting; explored inside experimental, participatory formats; covering topics of profound social value —this will always be Matter’s DNA.

              Isn’t it sick? The logo’s repeating horizontal lines create a vibrating pattern that hooks the human eye, making it hard to look away from. The lines’ thicks and thins create an illusion of something that is glowing, as if lit from within. It’s designed to be applied in an aggressive way on top of something else; a headline, a paragraph, photographs, other logos. It becomes an action, a gesture. We’re tagging something and telling people where to look.

              If we’ve learned anything from our past experiences in tech, publishing, news, and entertainment, it’s that talented creators will find eyes and ears and minds and hearts to rally around them, particularly if people are involved in the process and inspired by the creator’s voice.

              Our projects will be funded and published in a strategic, iterative way. This allows us to test the work as it is made, build an audience as we go, and give our company the funding flexibility it needs. So, consider the documentarian who needs $500K and two years to create 90 minutes of film. We may start with $15,000, one month, and 10 minutes of film, and grow the project from there.

              Okay, suppose you woke up earlier than usual this morning and checked your Twitter feed and saw a headline that made you laugh so hard you didn’t even need to read the article, and it gave you an idea for one of your characters. You gave this character their most tragic flaw which is that they only care about the surface of things. They read covers, never books, and this obviously has implications for how they interact with the world. Normally you’d need to clean your desk before writing and make coffee and put on Kid A but you wrote those 300 words in bed on your phone even though that fucking bird that loves your window was chirping out the bird translation of Ulysses. Your character left a job interview and drove across town for an online date that they felt a little too excited about and, as they walked into the coffee shop, your alarm went off and you remembered that you had to shower and be a person in the world. You got out of bed and as you walked to your window, the bird stopped chirping and turned its head toward you.

              There’s this episode of <em>Black Mirror</em> in which a character played by Jon Hamm is a dating guru that helps you achieve your goals. Hamm can see and hear everything that you see and hear via this pair of contact lenses--inevitably they will be the next iteration of Google Glass--and tells you what to wear, how to stand, who to speak with, and what to say. You have at your disposal a series of Hamm-approved anecdotes designed to make people laugh while opening them up, to make them feel comfortable and interested in you as a nuanced and attractive human being. Hamm is helping you tap into humanity’s basest needs and most universal vulnerabilities and successfully coaching you to subvert them using social cues, language, and gestures, with the goal of getting a person to desire you. He does this while being a literal voice in your ear and watching your life through wearable technology. Collaborating with Matter will feel like the exact opposite of this.

              Trust, we know where you’re coming from. The people are fucking saturated. We agonize over the ethics of creation because it means that we are asking busy people for their attention. And in exchange for their attention are we adding something new to the culture? Something necessary? Are we elevating the right voices? What stories are we not telling by choosing the ones we are telling? If you were to remove all the content in the world that is made by people who haven’t asked themselves these questions, what’s left? Do you still think there’s enough? There isn’t, because that work is harder to make. Again, it’s agony. But it’s also everything.

              There are times when we are happy but not always, which is normal right? Sometimes you need to feel incensed. Sometimes you need to ugly cry. It’s funny, we’ve run a Twitter series called Elegant Services in which we made people feel with different media type each week. We’ve done it with Vines, Bollywood gifs, power ballads, Laura Dern faces, etc. So we ask users how they want to feel. And the specificity of the feel is crucial. Instead of telling us you want to feel happy, we would need you to tell us that you want to feel like your crush invited you to his dorm room but you inadvertently knocked on the wrong door and have now just locked eyes with your true soulmate (for example). Because what is the Vine that captures that feeling? Probably <a class="link" href="https://vine.co/v/i1DKdQBQx9d">this one</a>. But what we’re trying to say here is that, yes, we can feel happy. But inside of happy, sad, anger, belonging, fear, disgust and the entire range of human emotion there are infinite ways to feel. Moreover, feeling them in powerful sequences is what the best stories do for us. Let’s make stuff like that.
