      "question": "What stops people from understanding themselves?",
      "answer": "Understanding comes from asking questions. As a civilization we’ve gained understanding about our worlds both around and within us by asking questions, finding answers, and then asking questions about those answers. The people that understand themselves best ask themselves questions."

Sometimes you need to feel incensed. Sometimes you need to ugly cry. It’s funny, we’ve run a Twitter series called Elegant Services in which we made people feel with a different media type each week. We’ve done it with Vines, Bollywood gifs, power ballads, Laura Dern faces, etc. So we ask users how they want to feel. And the specificity of the feel is crucial. Instead of telling us you want to feel happy, we would need you to tell us that you want to feel like your crush invited you to his dorm room but you inadvertently knocked on the wrong door and have now just locked eyes with your true soulmate (for example). Because what is the Vine that captures that feeling? Probably &lt;a class=\"link\" href=\"https://vine.co/v/i1DKdQBQx9d\"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. But what we’re trying to say here is that, yes, we can feel happy. But inside of happy, sad, anger, belonging, fear, disgust and the entire range of human emotion there are infinite ways to feel. Moreover, feeling them in powerful sequences is what the best stories do for us. Let’s make stuff like that.</content><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/1rzbzTQuAzRhv_QpU7fkQ1IeMj35Z1AVdKTkGxq4aOmw/od6/public/values/acas7'/><gsx:question>Are you happy?</gsx:question><gsx:answer>There are times when we are happy but not always, which is normal right?
